## Debates

* Artificial intelligence: the risks could outweigh the rewards
	* A moderated debate between Jaron Lanier, Andrew Keen, James Hughes & Martine Rothblatt, the motion in question: The risks of A.I. could outweigh the rewards. As technology rapidly progresses, some proponents of artificial intelligence believe that it will help solve complex social challenges and offer immortality via virtual humans. But AI’s critics are sounding the alarm, going so far as to call its development an “existential threat” to mankind. Is this the stuff of science fiction? Could the “Terminator” become reality, or will these fears prevent the next technological revolution?
