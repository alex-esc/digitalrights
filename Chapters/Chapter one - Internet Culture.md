# Chapter one - Internet Culture

## The web's missing link

Have you ever wondered were do the Internet memes or funny pictures on your phone came from? who made them and why? We know that pictures, jokes and other works of art have to come from someone, usually the question stops here, we came up with an answer and no further discussion is needed, but is this really a satisfactory answer? Media literacy attempts to answer these questions and explore communications mediums and their impact on people. To explore Ethics with a digital perspective means to speak the language before we can ask difficult questions, we must understand the social and technical aspects of the web and software to truly identify problems and to find solutions.

On our everyday life we enjoy discussing movies, music and other commercial products. The majority of us have a fascination for a specific movie, artist or celebrity, talking about media means criticizing and analyzing but very few of us create media rather than consuming it. Or at least this was the case before the Internet: Today more people than ever are creating something new, if you want to write you can open a blog, if you want to make a movie you can open a YouTube account, and little by little more people are getting involved in making new stuff. If you don't consider yourself a creative person you are still involved in making new original works, in past days when we wanted to share a particular moment or story we remembered it and speak about it, today the average teenage docent just chat about cool occurrences or stories, they capture them with apps like Snapchat, Snstagram or Whatsapp, these programs allow you to place stickers over the video or photo, you can add drawings or emojis and text, what was just a regular video was creatively transformed into something bigger than the sum of its parts.

Everyday people create content by creating and uploading their pictures, we transform content by commenting on a picture or post, we share our opinion, ask and answer questions online. The Internet is a platform driving mass communication, creativity and innovation, from a small scale Internet users are encouraged to speak their mind and on a big scale users are proud to show off their artistic works.

## Sharing and remix

Humans have a natural drive for innovation thanks to evolution but once we figured out how to fulfill our basic needs like food and shelter we begin to specialize, we dive into social, economic, artistic and more and more abstract subjects. But creativity and innovation is commonly perceived unrealistically, we tend to think of creative leaders like the stories that portray them, for example: _Isaac Newton was just stinging about minding his own business and suddenly it hit him! He felt the apple hitting his head and it gave him the hypothesis for gravity, then he ran for the lab and after countless testing he figured out the theory of gravity, just like that!_... well this story sound very heroic and all but it kind of misses the point of creativity. Stories like Isaac's or Thomas Edison tell us how their great minds had a revelation of sorts, this eureka moment is often portrayed as a spark of genius, not because all creative or scientific genius experience this moment, but because it makes a better and more memorable story.

What people tend to forget is that creativity or having a great idea is not a matter of one eureka moment, creativity is an additive process. To explain with more detail I will borrow one of Richard Dawkins's allegories: Imagine the creative process is like climbing a mountain, it is very unreasonable to believe that one can get to the top of mountain creativity with one single jump, to assume all creative works are spawned out of one single leap is ridiculous, a more probable explanation is that to go to the top of mountain creativity it takes millions of small steps, the addition of every single step ads up to an achievement greater than the sum of its parts.

To create something new is to add to an existing concept, the iPhone is nothing more than a cellular phone plus an Internet connected computer, a Ford model T is just a motor plus an engine. All inventions follow this pattern because all creative works are additive.

Putting the pieces together has never been easier than with the digital landscape, with the web everyone with access can download any piece of media and combining them into something new. This is known as _remix_ in the world of music, thanks to digital recordings artists unlocked the ability to use bites of other people's songs in works of their own, this is known as sampling. The action of taking someone else's work and using part of it for your commercial benefit may sound unethical at first glance but sampling and remixes alike share one thing in common: they are transformative, for example the 1976 track 'Theme from the Planets' arranged by Dexter Wansel is an instrumental synthesizer driven jazz inspired song, the song is very upbeat and dreamy, it features Charles Collins and Joe Johnson on drums and percussion, the song is most known for it's beat, most popularly sampled on Dido's 2000 hit single 'Thank You', a more relaxed and hopeful feeling track with religious connotations, the two most popular interpretations is that the singer is ether thankful with her love interest or god, this is far from the melancholy and rap driven track 'stan' from Enimem, the track released on the year 2000 features a remixed version of the first verse from Dido's 'Thank you', the track tells the story of an obsessive character called satn who is obsessed with the real life artist Eminem and how his obsession drove him to the grave.

From a happy synth driven instrumental to a calm worship song to a gloomy rap song is as far apart as you can get. sampling and remixing is crucial for songwriting and other creative activities, in the case of music it could be argued that there is a limited number of catchy chord progressions, drum patterns and melodies and this is why picking and matching elements is key to creating a great work of art. The same holds true for literature, movies, poetry, etcetera. A remix culture is a sign of embracing creativity and in a more literal perspective, it can be concluded that innovation and inventions are essentially remixes of previously available media and technology.

To illustrate this point let's play a simple game, don't read ahead just trust me: I'll tell you the plot to a story and you'll try to guess who is the main character:

There was a state of peace and tranquility on the world, peace driven by the status quo, another day and life stays the same in a etiquette balance like it always has been, we follow our protagonist on the mundane and get to know him but suddenly something happens, a signal is calling for him and he must enroll on his quest, but he can't confront a strange new world on his own so he gets assistance from a new character with great wisdom, now he heads straight in towards his goal, he has great difficulty and faces his greatest challenge and is defeated, the protagonist enters his rock bottom only to recharge and accomplish his greatest challenge, after he succeeds he must gets great treasure from him and has to get out of the strange place he tied himself in, he returns to regular life and finds our that something changed inside him and around him, any loose ends with previous characters gets fixed now and the sorry ends with self reflexion.

So did you guessed whose story was that? if you think I cheated you by describing a vague plot line and that there is no correct answer you'd be wrong! only 50 percent. That was the story about the hero of Joseph Campbell, on his book _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_, he explores the archetypal hero and his writings have sparked great inspiration on the worlds most famous and critically acclaimed storytellers like George Lucas , Bob Dylan, Stanley Kubrick and many others.

In a way all stories about heroes are remixes on the so called _hero's journey_ (the popular term used to refer to Joseph Campbell's hero), an artist heard a story with this structure and it's deep connections with everyday struggles of the common man inspired him to write a similar story.

Stories, structures and archetypes are the foundation of all stories, and to remix is analogous to the creative process, just think on all the movies, books, music that is based on another creative work, filmmaker Kirby Ferguson said it best on his classic 2010 video essay 'Everything is a Remix'. Ferguson argues that to remix you need to: _copy, transform and combine_:

>_"It's how you remix. You take existing songs, you chop them up, you transform the pieces, you combine them back together again, you've got a new song, but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs, but I think these aren't just the component of remixing, I think these are the basic elements of all creativity"_

## It rimes with gene

Using big artists as an example for remix culture docent really gives us the full picture, to understand remix culture we are going to dive into how ideas are shared and the title should give you a clue of what this section will build up to. But first of all _what is remix culture?_


Going back to the opening quote on the meaning of freedom: no fear, being free to create means no fear of punishment for creativity. Empowering to create, tearing down barriers of entry and promoting creative works are characteristics of a remix culture. On the other hand you have a consumer culture, a place that encourages the consumption of media only, being feed entrainment through the television screen constantly is a world we could create, this is also commonly refereed as a _read only culture_. Professor and political activist Lawrence Lessig coined this term of read only culture, analogous to a computer's hard drive, culture can both read and write content to itself.


<!-- Lessig, L. (2009). Remix: Making art and commerce thrive in the hybrid economy. New York, N.Y: Penguin Books. -->


Read - write culture and remix culture are used interchangeably due to Lawrence's analogy, in other words free culture and remix culture is a culture of innovation and creativity first. The most obvious example of constant remix and editing of content and probably the example you are most familiar with is _Internet culture_.

Great minds taking notes and inspiration from one another and basing their designs and works through tedious amounts of labor is a thing of the past, now with the connections provided via the web, we can all easily copy, transform and combine any work with a few clicks or taps of the finger. The world wide web was a strange place at the beginning, nobody knew how to use this new medium: Should you create a website, about what topic? and then what? do you leave it there forever in hopes somebody discovered it like a hidden gem? well if natural history had taught us anything is that _evolution always wins_, at one point of humanity's history we had a similar problem: how will an individual human survive? well by developing a society, one might not stand against the terrors of nature but a group will stand a better chance. And so the net became social, people realized that there is no difference between the best website with nobody to share it with than no website at all and so we formed online groups and Internet culture began to form.

The interactions between Internet users begun to shift towards free culture, since there is no cost for reproduction or copy of any online work, no more labor required to copy a text or video or image lead to countless montages and collages of media. The products of early Internet media may seem strange compared to todays Internet media but they both share something in common: their means of survival. Ideas and socially shared media go through a natural selection and evolutionary process just like living organisms, living creatures look to survive nature for as long as possible and ideas look to survive in the minds of the public for as long as possible.

Think of it like newspaper headlines, the writer of a story or report wants their story to reach more people to increase sales and therefore their salary, so a writer asks himself: _How can I capture the most hears and minds with one story?_ Writer 'A' might write about something controversial, like politics, and writer 'B' may make a story about something popular like a celebrity pop star. Both articles A & B are fighting for the publics attention and only the more interesting article will win in the end, writers like Jeff Weiss won the attention of the public on October 30 2018 by combining politics and pop stars by writing an article on r&b and rap artist Post Malone and comparing him to Donald Trump among other allegations. Articles from writers A and B are entities fighting for survival via natural selection by the public reader, the ideas behind the articles combined and evolved to form article C. These parallels help un-clutter the field, and we can see the similarities between the spread of popular ideas and natural selection and evolution.

The spread and evolution of genetic information is carried _through the media of genes_, while the spread and evolution of ideas in the general scene is carried _through the media of memes_. Genes carry genetic information while memes carry cultural information, to drive the point further Dictionary.com defines a meme as: "_a cultural item that is transmitted by repetition and replication in a manner analogous to the biological transmission of genes._"


<!-- Meme. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.dictionary.com/browse/meme -->

The word meme itself is contrived from the Greek word _"μίμημα"_ pronounced as _mīmēma_ [míːmɛːma], it means _to imitate_ or _mimic_, a way to think of it is mimmic-gene or meme for short. Memes go way back, since all ideas are essentially fighting for survival in our minds only the best ideas will be remembered, a classic example of a good meme is clothing, since it was such a good idea to protect our delicate bodies from the outside world we never went back, this meme has engraved itself into our minds.
