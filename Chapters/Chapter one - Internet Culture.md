# Chapter one - Internet Culture

Have you ever wondered were do the Internet memes or funny pictures on your phone came from? who made them and why? We know that pictures, jokes and other works of art have to come from someone, usually the question stops here, we came up with an answer and no further discussion is needed, but is this really a satisfactory answer? Media literacy attempts to answer these questions and explore communications mediums and their impact on people. To explore Ethics with a digital perspective means to speak the language before we can ask difficult questions, we must understand the social and technical aspects of the web and software to truly identify problems and to find solutions.

On our everyday life we enjoy discussing movies, music and other commercial products. The majority of us have a fascination for a specific movie, artist or celebrity, talking about media means criticizing and analyzing but very few of us create media rather than consuming it. Or at least this was the case before the Internet: Today more people than ever are creating something new, if you want to write you can open a blog, if you want to make a movie you can open a YouTube account, and little by little more people are getting involved in making new stuff. If you don't consider yourself a creative person you are still involved in making new original works, in past days when we wanted to share a particular moment or story we remembered it and speak about it, today the average teenage docent just chat about cool occurrences or stories, they capture them with apps like Snapchat, Snstagram or Whatsapp, these programs allow you to place stickers over the video or photo, you can add drawings or emojis and text, what was just a regular video was creatively transformed into something bigger than the sum of its parts.

Everyday people create content by creating and uploading their pictures, we transform content by commenting on a picture or post, we share our opinion, ask and answer questions online. The Internet is a platform driving mass communication, creativity and innovation, from a small scale Internet users are encouraged to speak their mind and on a big scale users are proud to show off their artistic works.

## Sharing and remix

Humans have a natural drive for innovation thanks to evolution but once we figured out how to fulfill our basic needs like food and shelter we begin to specialize, we dive into social, economic, artistic and more and more abstract subjects. But creativity and innovation is commonly perceived unrealistically, we tend to think of creative leaders like the stories that portray them, for example: _Isaac Newton was just stinging about minding his own business and suddenly it hit him! He felt the apple hitting his head and it gave him the hypothesis for gravity, then he ran for the lab and after countless testing he figured out the theory of gravity, just like that!_... well this story sound very heroic and all but it kind of misses the point of creativity. Stories like Isaac's or Thomas Edison tell us how their great minds had a revelation of sorts, this eureka moment is often portrayed as a spark of genius, not because all creative or scientific genius experience this moment, but because it makes a better and more memorable story.

What people tend to forget is that creativity or having a great idea is not a matter of one eureka moment, creativity is an additive process. To explain with more detail I will borrow one of Richard Dawkins's allegories: Imagine the creative process is like climbing a mountain, it is very unreasonable to believe that one can get to the top of mountain creativity with one single jump, to assume all creative works are spawned out of one single leap is ridiculous, a more probable explanation is that to go to the top of mountain creativity it takes millions of small steps, the addition of every single step ads up to an achievement greater than the sum of its parts.

To create something new is to add to an existing concept, the iPhone is nothing more than a cellular phone plus an Internet connected computer, a Ford model T is just a motor plus an engine. All inventions follow this pattern because all creative works are additive.

Putting the pieces together has never been easier than with the digital landscape, with the web everyone with access can download any piece of media and combining them into something new. This is known as _remix_ in the world of music, thanks to digital recordings artists unlocked the ability to use bites of other people's songs in works of their own, this is known as sampling. The action of taking someone else's work and using part of it for your commercial benefit may sound unethical at first glance but sampling and remixes alike share one thing in common: they are transformative, for example the 1976 track 'Theme from the Planets' arranged by Dexter Wansel is an instrumental synthesizer driven jazz inspired song, the song is very upbeat and dreamy, it features Charles Collins and Joe Johnson on drums and percussion, the song is most known for it's beat, most popularly sampled on Dido's 2000 hit single 'Thank You', a more relaxed and hopeful feeling track with religious connotations, the two most popular interpretations is that the singer is ether thankful with her love interest or god, this is far from the melancholy and rap driven track 'stan' from Enimem, the track released on the year 2000 features a remixed version of the first verse from Dido's 'Thank you', the track tells the story of an obsessive character called satn who is obsessed with the real life artist Eminem and how his obsession drove him to the grave.

From a happy synth driven instrumental to a calm worship song to a gloomy rap song is as far apart as you can get. sampling and remixing is crucial for songwriting and other creative activities, in the case of music it could be argued that there is a limited number of catchy chord progressions, drum patterns and melodies and this is why picking and matching elements is key to creating a great work of art. The same holds true for literature, movies, poetry, etcetera. A remix culture is a sign of embracing creativity and in a more literal perspective, it can be concluded that innovation and inventions are essentially remixes of previously available media and technology. This view was popularized by the filmmaker Kirby Ferguson on his classic 2010 video essay 'Everything is a Remix'
