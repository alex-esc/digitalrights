# Manual - how to read this book

Welcome, this manual documents some basic things to take in mind to read the content of this project while the project is incomplete.

> Last manual revision on November 8th 2018.

## Something to keep in mind

The goal of this project is to document and explain the new ideas regarding human rights and ethics in the digital world in plain English that anyone can understand without any prior knowledge, this is why this manual exists too, my goal is to make the ideas as accessible as possible.

The ideas expressed on this work are ideas not commonly associated with common knowledge, basic ethical or moral concepts are popularly known by the public, figures from Aristotle to Jordan Peterson are in the public mind, and this is wonderful for the development of ethics on modern society, but the biggest problems to face society in the future may stem from systems the public docent understand, this systems are algorithms and rules that work on the Internet and facing those future problems blind is something I wish to change with this project.

Now to start reading the book you need some basic technical knowledge: If you know how to use github or you are comfortable you'll figure it out you can skip the rest of this manual. If you are a beginner you can use the rest of this manual as reference.

## Were can I find the PDF?

Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really do appreciate it, but unfortunately the project on its infancy state and so far there is no PDF version of the book.

In order to read the content you need to navigate the files on this website, listed here are all the files that form the book, the main file is called 'digital-rights.md' and its the meat of the book, also in the future I might expand this book and later chapters will be inside folders called 'chapter one' two, three ... and so on.

To begin to read the book or a specific chapter just click on it and the website will display the formated text.

If you wish to download this book for later and offline use you must to _download the repository of this book_, if you are viewing this inside an Internet browser on a website called 'GitHub' you will notice a green button that says **'Clone or download'**, clicking it will trigger a text box asking to download on desktop or download as a ZIP file. If you click 'download ZIP' the download will begin, once finished you must unlock the zip file, if you are not familiar with zip files I will advise you to [click on this link on instructions on how to unlock a zip file](https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File).

Once you downloaded and unzipped the file you can access the books contents offline, because this is an early draft of the book you will notice all the text is written on a different kind file type, most text documents are stored on .txt files or .docx but almost all files here are saved under .md, this format is called Markdown.

## What software do I need?

So this is written in Markdown, so do I need do download a program to open .md files? the answer is _no_, If you are on a Windows or Microsoft computer you can just click on any .md file and it will open with notepad, if you are on a Mac or Apple computer just by double clicking on a Markdown file you will be able to open it on TextEdit or TextMate.

If you open a .md file you will notice that there are some hashtags or number signs, asterisks (or stars) and underscores, you can mostly ignore this, this is because the document is not yet compiled as a PDF.

If you want to convert this book into PDF yourself you need a tool called _Pandoc_, more information on pandoc can be found [following this link](https://pandoc.org/).
