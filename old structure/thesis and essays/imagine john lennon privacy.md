# Privacy, Imagine that!

The idea of privacy has a long story, in the beginning of humankind we had no notion for it, since our species operated on purely Darwinist impulses. At one point, the when question is beyond the scope of this book, but regardless, at some point we developed empathy, and only then the roots for privacy were settled. Until the invention of written text we formalize the story. Now our happenings could be reproduced in detailed descriptions of the past. Stories and overarching narratives could begin to develop, some of them will eventually canonize themselves into ideologies and dogma. But our understanding of privacy goes beyond the notion of the self, and our stories. For us to desire privacy we must first desire not to loose control over our stories, in some way the idea of property itself came into the mix. For us to understand the creation of privacy we must first think about the world prior to todays ideological motives. This is especially difficult, for the presence of ideology is predominant. It can seem absurd to think of a world without several things and ideas, but this exercise is not a philosophers game, we can use John Lennon's popular 1971 song *Imagine*.

>Imagine there's no heaven
>It's easy if you try
>No hell below us
>Above us only sky
>Imagine all the people
>Living for today... Aha-ah...
>
>Imagine there's no countries
>It isn't hard to do
>Nothing to kill or die for
>And no religion, too
>Imagine all the people
>Living life in peace... You...
>
>You may say I'm a dreamer
>But I'm not the only one
>I hope someday you'll join us
>And the world will be as one
>
>Imagine no possessions
>I wonder if you can
>No need for greed or hunger
>A brotherhood of man
>Imagine all the people
>Sharing all the world... You...
>
>You may say I'm a dreamer
>But I'm not the only one
>I hope someday you'll join us
>And the world will live as one

John Lennon's anthem can read as a utopic vision, but we must however remember than all the items Lennon wants to imagine a world without; religion, nations and possessions; were at some point in human history absent. *Imagine* invites us to theorize, to imagine, a world built around unity and solidarity. The song is of course advocating for change, to escape or current oppressive society, be it in our imaginations only, but an escapist work nonetheless.

This objects we're supposed to imagine away were, at some point, equally viewed as a utopia. Building a world where people are entitled to owning stuff was at some point a radical dream, as well as uniting the majority of the world under the banner of Christianity, to organize a nation looked like fantasy to a nomad society. But great effort was put into materializing these dreams, we fought wars over religions nations and possessions because the ruling class desired a world with these elements. Even John Lennon himself is not advocating against private property since this song is owned privately.

If the text of the song looks to undo what others believed to be a utopia, we can look at both themes, the old world and the new imagined world as basis for understanding some aspects privacy. *Imagine* emanates this notion of world peace, this tranquility comes from the absence of outside forces working against humanities best interests, I claim that the struggle for privacy is similar in this manner. An abstract value is not going to spawn into the room, we must theorize about it, find the logic behind it, and before implementing it we must image it to be true. The push for privacy has been contradicted by external forces such as the interests of corporations, in some strange way the tree items we ought to imagine away in the song relate to forces that are keeping privacy from us.

Privacy throughout history has been influenced by religion, many monotheist religions are organized with a clear bureaucracy. God is the ultimate creator and king, thus his creations are supposed to work, labor and praise him simply for this position on top of the pyramid. Private thoughts are, in extreme conditions, discouraged if not properly aligned with the divine plan. The predominant ideology of religion has sparkled this line of thinking outside of the church and into secular spaces such as government or corporate bureaucracy. When we came to organize the corporation or the nation, also present in John's song, we adopted this hierarchical model of omnipresent surveillance. The logic of surveillance in religion works because our deity is all-capable of anything, including always on surveillance of his entire creation to make sure everything goes according to plan. Same happen in non-religious hierarchical organizations, for business to thrive or for workers to behave morally we must put in place a system of checks and balances; reports, check-ins, progress revision, supervising and so on. This form of organization is modeled after a divine framework, but when we're talking about religion we at least have someone at the top responsible for all, secular bureaucracy however has no king at the top. Bureaucrats report to one another, thus creating a circle of surveillance. I am managed by my supervisor, he reports to the manager, she addresses the business owner, and the owner responds to the market, made out of the supervisors, manages and regular workers. Everyone always checks on everyone else, but the report goes nowhere new, we set up this circular system of surveillance were the output is never displayed on a screen or archived, but send the data sniping in circles. The notion of private property means that your private information, can not only be owned by yourself, but by other people. The bureaucratic model or organizing encourages your data to be pushed around and owned by nobody in particular.

Meaning that a world organized hierarchically and with the need for self reinforcement will inevitably require some level of citizen, private or religious surveillance. If we want to imagine a more private world, we ought not to disregard the world imagined by John Lennon.
