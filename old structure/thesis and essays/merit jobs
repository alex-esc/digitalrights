# On Steve Jobs and merit

On tech circles we have our gurus and heroes. let's take one of the classic champions of the information age: Steve Jobs. Steve, as you already know, founded Apple computers. Jobs' brand evokes strong emotions and it is the number one example on how to build a brand. Marketing people love them, Design and arts people love them, Everyday people who look for simplicity love them. Music people love them. Apple made many choices, good or bad, they created a cultural phenomenon. The captain, the architect of this empire is in the minds of you're everyday layperson is none other that Steve Jobs.

The story goes that he was just a kid with a dream, a vision for a paradigm shift in personal computers. He made several projects with his best friend (and fellow Steve) Mr. Wozniak and suddenly it happened. Our dream is that on a Silicon Valley garage they boys had a discussion for the direction of their new computer model: Jobs wanted to remove ports and simplify the computer, Wozniak was shocked, *We need expansion slots, Steve!* he replied. And they yelled and yelled but after the night settled Wozniak gave into Jobs' vision and for the first time the computer was not a product for engineers and professionals, but for everyday people. The idea would be refined with the Macintosh and the invention of the mouse: Now people could point and click instead of using cryptic codes to use the computer.

Steve's idea was revolutionary. The computer had great potencial, not for professional use, but for humanity as a whole. He thought of computers as a bicycle for the mind. On a 1990 interview he said:

> *I remember reading an article when I was about twelve years old. I think it might have been Scientific American where they measured the efficiency of locomotion for all these species on planet earth. How many kilocalories did they expend to get from point A to point B? And the Condor came in at the top of the list [...] but somebody there had the imagination to test the efficiency of a human riding a bicycle. A human riding a bicycle blew away the Condor, all the way off the top of the list. And it made a really big impression on me that we humans are tool builders. And that we can fashion tools that amplify these inherent abilities that we have to spectacular magnitudes. And so for me, a computer has always been a bicycle of the mind. Something that takes us far beyond our inherent abilities.*

For Jobs' we might not be the strongest, most fit animals around, but we have great intelligence to create tools to amplify our inherent abilities. We can compensate for our weaknesses and create something great, and for him computers were a crucial part for becoming a better selves and building a better world.

Then Steve was crowned as a genius, me might be one of the truly outstanding figures of the information age. But his image, as described as people on the streets, is one of almost divine levels. He has two theatrical movie releases where he is painted as a crazy genius. A mad scientist too smart for this earth. Apple, the company is not longer a brand, more than a bumper sticker, it's almost a religion. Apple fanatics have in-fights about the grandiose nature of Steve's work, they occupy their corner of the internet with injokes and their own self contained culture. They flood non-apple spaces to prove that Mac*s* are superior than Microsoft or Linux software. For the not-so-devoted to the fandom, apple users have created an archetype for themselves. Apple products, especially the iPhone, Apple AirBuds in wired and wireless variant, are interpreted by others as a status symbol of wealth and class.

Apple uses who don't consider themselves as part of the fandom still internalize their perceived superiority over Android branded products. Because they look nice, feel premium and work well they are seen as overall good. But somewhere along the line something happened here. A reversal and subversion of values took place. In the beginning of our Apple narrative the computer was an equalizer and a force for hope. But today we don't see apple products as democratic, equalizers, or holistic. The ethos of modern day Apple is one of separation, wealth and elitism. How did this happened? If the initial values and ideals of Apple, and by extension of Steve's ideology, how is the outcome not consistent?

Because this is a narrative, and not what actually happened with Jobs' story. An alternative explanation that does account for and would correctly predict the divisive outcome of Apple products is that they were never supposed to act as equalizers, as the bicycle *vs.* nature anecdote implied, but as tools for competition and leaving others behind.

Looking at Steve Jobs and apple through the lens of competition instead of equality also equates for their tactics as a company and their outlook on merit and patent violation. It also accounts for why Steve is seen as the architect, the sole creator of an empire, and ignores the works and effort of hundreds of people. The people responsible for the iPhone are not idolized like Steve is, precisely because Steve's mindset is one of competition, he consciously tried to "look better" and smarter than them. That's why he tells the story of his struggle as a thought leader and not as a software worker. He wanted to crush whom he saw as "standing in his way". With this competition ideology everybody must be on his way. Because it's all about winners and losers.

Jobs' mindset made him present himself as the deity we see him as today. But he could not, did not, and would never admit to not being a crazy genius archetype. This notion of himself is inconsistent, as the equalizer narrative. Because he did wanted to make computers the bicycle of the mind for humanity, and at the same time the bicycle of the few. This ideology is field with contradictions: He boasts about furthering humanity with technology as a bicycle, subscribes to and believes in Picasso's quote that *"Good artists copy, but great artists steal"* and at the same time he despises android, quote:

> *"I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."*

But the iPhone is not an original idea *per se*, cellphones had been around long before, computers and microchips have too, touchscreens, Internet connectivity and its protocols were not eureka moments on Steve's garage. They were here first. NOt only that, but
